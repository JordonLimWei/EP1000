        Computer Aided Design also known as CAD, are digital softwares that we
        use on our computer to help in the creation of our designs. In this
        module, we are using CAD vector tools to mainly draw and model our
        designs which will then have digital information extracted for
        fabrication. The CAD software we are using is Autodesk Fusion 360, more
        on the exercises I did using this software.

        3D Extrusion
        In Fusion 360, a product is made with a few building blocks. Firstly, the main structure is drawn in a 2D sketch where they are contrained and dimensioned to make them fixed in a position. Secondly, after creating a sketch, a solid can be made from them an]d a body is formed. Multiple bodies can be combined together and lastly form a component.
