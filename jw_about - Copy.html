            <p>
            As a huge car enthusiast, I really like spending my time playing racing
            games on my desktop, some games I currently enjoy playing are Rocket
            League and Forza Horizon 5. I  am also really interested in prehistoric
            creatures such as dinosaurs, with their accurate appearance being still
            largely unknown, I like using my imagination as well as other's
            interpretation, such as from films like Jurassic Park/ World, to sketch
            these creatures on my sketch book. From there, I develop and improve my
            skills of sketching.
