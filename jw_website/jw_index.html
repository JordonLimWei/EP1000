          <p>Hello there! Welcome to my website where I document all
          the things I learnt and worked on during my time in this
          Digital Fabrication and Prototyping Fundamentals Module(EP1000).
          You can make use of the navigation bar above to navigate around
          my website.</p>
          <p>EP1000 is a module that aims to teach students on how to use Digital
          Fabrication techniques starting from the design concept to the realisation
          of the product, all with the aid of computers and softwares. Designs can
          be created with the use of Computer Aided Design(CAD)
          softwares, 2D and 3D modeling, and product realisation can be fabricated
          with the use of additive and subtractive manufacturing machines, like 3D
          printers, laser cutters and milling machines, with time spent reduced to
          a minimum. All these techniques will come into use on a prototyped
          project students are required to accomplish by the end of the module.
          Web development and version control is an essential part in
          documentation, which will come into play to record down the whole digital
          and fabrication processes of the project.</p>
