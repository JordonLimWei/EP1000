        Here is where I will be documenting the process of making my final project.
        The purpose of this project is for me to integrate what I have learnt over
        the course of this module which shall include 3D modelling with the used
        of computer aided design softwares as well as parts to be fabricated with
        machines such as the laser cutting machine and 3D printing machine. With
        the time span of this final project only lasting for 3 week, I decided to
        create something simple yet practical and it is simply titled as the
        Macro Numpad.

        <h2>What does it do?</h2>
      </div>
      <div id="box">
        The Macro Numpad is simply what is named, it acts as a numberpad as
        well as a macro pad which have mapped keys to assist the user with work
        and help to make the use of editing softwares much easier and
        efficient. It has a total of 3 layouts, and 1 default layout which is the
        number pad, you can be toggle between the layouts at any time. This
        device can be plugged into a desktop, laptop or any device that has the
        USB type A port and it can be used on that device.
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>What are it's features?</h2>
      </div>
      <div id="box">
        Some of the features of the Macro Numpad include:<br>
        <li>4x4 membrane keypad with 3 layouts and default number pad:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Default layout: Number pad</li>
          <li>Layout 1: Editing functions(select all, cut, copy, paste, undo, redo, snip, save)</li>
          <li>Layout 2: Discord funstions(server cycling, channel cycling, mute, deafen, share your screen)</li>
          <li>Layout 3: Media functions(Pause/play, increase volume, decrease volume, mute)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>3 available LEDs lights up to indicate the current layout of the 3 mapped layouts</li>

        <h2>Research</h2>
      </div>
      <div id="box">
        After doing some research to get some inspiration and ideas of how I
        shall design the product, I was curious to see if there is anyone who
        did something similar to how I am wanting to make my product. To my
        surprise, there is someone who took this module in 2021 semester 1, he
        goes by the name of Lynn, who did a RGB macropad which something really
        similar to what I have been wanting to make. The main features for his
        macropad are some basic functions such as editing and media functions, as
        well as the toggleable RGB lighting. The design of his macropad is also
        really compact and smart, such as the 3D printed RGB support acting as
        the support for the RGB light strip, a mount for the keypad as well as
        slots to install side panel. He also made a mount for his Arduino
        micro-controller not only to fix the micro-controller in place, but also
        to protect the input port of the Arduino board. With all these positives
        of Lynn's design, I would like to incorprate them into my product as well
        and I hope that he would not mind. Click this
        <a href="https://lynn-mma.github.io/EP1000/final.html">link</a> to visit
        his website to learn more about how he did his RGB macropad and to give
        credit for his work.
