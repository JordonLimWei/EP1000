        Here is where I will be documenting the process of making my final project.
        The purpose of this project is for me to integrate what I have learnt over
        the course of this module which shall include 3D modelling with the used
        of computer aided design softwares as well as parts to be fabricated with
        machines such as the laser cutting machine and 3D printing machine. With
        the time span of this final project only lasting for 3 week, I decided to
        create something simple yet practical and it is simply titled as the
        Macro Numpad.
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>What does it do?</h2>
      </div>
      <div id="box">
        The Macro Numpad is simply what is named, it acts as a numberpad as
        well as a macro pad which have mapped keys to assist the user with work
        and help to make the use of editing softwares much easier and
        efficient. It has a total of 2 layouts, and 1 default layout which is the
        number pad, you can be toggle between the layouts at any time. This
        device can be plugged into a desktop, laptop or any device that has the
        USB type A port and to the Macro Numpad through a micro USB cable. The
        Macro Numpad can then be used on that connected device.
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>What are it's features?</h2>
      </div>
      <div id="box">
        Some of the features of the Macro Numpad include:<br>
        <li>4x4 membrane keypad with 2 layouts and default number pad:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Default layout: Number pad</li>
          <li>Layout 1: Editing functions(select all, cut, copy, paste, undo, redo, snip, save)</li>
          <li>Layout 2: Discord funstions(server cycling, channel cycling, mute, deafen, share your screen)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>3 available LEDs lights up to indicate the current layout of the 3 mapped layouts</li>

        <h2>Research</h2>
      </div>
      <div id="box">
        After doing some research to get some inspiration and ideas of how I
        shall design the product, I was curious to see if there is anyone who
        did something similar to how I am wanting to make my product. To my
        surprise, there is someone who took this module in 2021 semester 1, he
        goes by the name of Lynn, who did a RGB macropad which is something
        similar to what I have been wanting to make.<br>The main features for his
        macropad are some basic functions such as editing and media functions, as
        well as toggleable RGB lighting. The design of his macropad is also
        really compact and smart, such as the 3D printed RGB support acting as
        the support for the RGB light strip, a mount for the keypad as well as
        slots to install the side plates. He also made a mount for his Arduino
        micro-controller not only to fix the micro-controller in place, but also
        to protect the input port of the Arduino board. With all these positives
        of Lynn's design, I would like to incorprate them into my product as well
        and I hope that he would not mind. Click this
        <a href="https://lynn-mma.github.io/EP1000/final.html">link</a> to visit
        his website to learn more about how he did his RGB macropad and to give
        credit for his work.

      <div id="box">
        With reference to Lynn's design, I incorprated a mount for the LEDs on
        the right side of the keypad, with each LED aligning with the corresponding
        layout buttons. Also, knowing that the 3D printed parts will shrink in
        size due to contraction after cooling, I made sure to leave at least a
        0.2mm clearance for any slide fit.

        Here is how the soldered Arduino looks. As you can see, I did not
        solder the LED directly to the resistor and ground wires due to the
        need to assemble the LED mount first before connecting the LEDs. Instead,
        I made use of female connecting wires to act as connecting ports to connect
        the LEDs later during assembly.This also acts as future proofing where
        if one of your LEDs might not be working, you can just disconnect the
        wires and replace the LED instead of having to resolder everything.

        Here I included two libraries, Keypad.h by Mark Stanley and Alexander Brevig
        and Keyboard.h by Arduino. The Keypad.h library includes functions that
        allow me to incorprate the 4x4 matrix keypad while the Keyboard.h library
        allows me to do keyboard functions.
        Click this <a href="https://playground.arduino.cc/Code/Keypad/">link</a>
        to learn more about the various funtions for the Keypad.h library.
        And click this <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/usb/keyboard/">link</a>

        <img id="horiImg" src="images/final_project/arduino/code2.jpg">
        With the Keypad.h library installed, here is how you would define your

        <br>
        <img id="horiImg" src="images/final_project/arduino/code3.jpg">
        From this set of codes, the .getKey gets the key that is pressed on the
        keypad. This then allows for the case 'key' to do a digital.write('-')
        where - is the keypad number pressed. Here you can replace the '-' in
        digital.write('-') to any set of characters that you may want to type,
        in a way it kind of acts like a Serial.println().<br>
        <br >
        <img id="horiImg" src="images/final_project/arduino/code4.jpg">
        From this set of codes, instead of using digital.write('-') to do an
        character output, in this case I used digital.press('-') to do key presses
        of key from your keyboard. This function allows you to do digital presses
        of any key on your keyboard and '-' can be modified to any modifier key.
        Click this <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/usb/keyboard/keyboardmodifiers/">link</a>
        to see the list of modifier keys available. Do take not that when you

        Slide the back plate of the pro micro assembly into the back slots of

        the wiring diagram for reference.

        Slide the plates into the slots of the support frame slots like so. You
        might shift the keypad out of the way to slide the plate into the front
        slots.

        Put the keypad into place on the support frame and assemble the top plate
        with the four corner holes through the screws as such and tighten the
        whole thing with the washer and nuts. And finally, you have successfully
        fully assembled your very own Macro Keypad.

        <h2>Things to improve on</h2>
      </div>
      <div id="box">
        First thing I would like to improve on the design is that despite having
        a 0.2mm allowance for slide fits, lots of the parts are very hard to
        slide into place, therefore I would like to maybe increase the allowance
        to 0.4mm to allow for easier fit when assembling.<br>
        Second thing I would like to improve on are the fitting of the spacers
        for the keypad, currently the keypad does slide around due to extra
        spaceing between the spacers and the keypad and by reducing the gap, it
        will prevent the keypad from sliding too much.<br>
        Last thing I would like to improve on is the feet, currently the all the
        feet are slide fitted onto the head of the screw which was not the
        original intention as it was originally suppose to be screwed between the
        screw head and the base plate. To improve on this, the feet should be
        made bigger such that it can fit onto the head of the screw better.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      </div>
      <div id="box">
        After completing this final project, I have come to the end of this
        course, EP1000. Over the course of this final project, I learnt how to
        implement and make use of the skills and softwares I learnt throughout
        the whole course to create a working prototype. I personally feel that
        the skills and knowledge I obtained here are benefitial to me as it made
        me see another aspect of how to go about creating a prototype, not only
        that, the operation of machines such as the 3D printer and laser cutter
        to digitally fabricate parts made me see how efficient making a component
        can be and are useful skills to have when I do operate such machines in
        future. However, the downside of the final project is that I find myself
        lacking the time to complete the project to my expectations, this could
        be mainly due to my poor time management and prioritisation though it
        could also be due to the project deadline is in the mids of my examinations
        and one thing I would like to do better is probably work on this final
        project slightly earlier. All in all, I enjoy my time during this course
        and would recommend it to someone who has the interest of fabricating
        your own product or simply likes to create something as I genuinely think
        that this is the course for you.
