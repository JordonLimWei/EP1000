        At the beginning of this module, we were tasked to research and select
        software tools that we would like to use for digital fabrication and
        other applications. Below is a table to tools that I personally chosen
        with the corresponding reasons as to why I chose them.
        </div>
        <table id="tools">
          <tr>
            <th>Purpose</th>
            <th>Choice</th>

              <tr>
                <td>Text Editor</td>
            <td>Atom</td>
            <td>As introduce by my lecturer, it is said that atom is similar to
            SublimeText3 which is his editor of choice. Selecting Atom will be
            easier to refer to.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Graphics Editor</td>
            <td>GIMP</td>
            <td>GIMP is a graphics editor rivalling Photoshop. Since Photoshop is
            a paid software, the free alterative would be GIMP.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Vector Editor</td>
            <td>InkScape</td>

          easier for me to learn this vector editing software.</td>

          <tr>
            <td>Screen Capture</td>
            <td>PicPick</td>
            <td>Out of all the selection of screen capturing softwares, only
            PicPick is available for Windows operating computers which I am
            using.</td>

            sizes that you want.</td>

            <td>CAD System</td>
            <td>Fusion 360</td>
            <td>Though I have learnt other software like AutoCAD and Inventor, I
            would love to learn another CAD software to my arsenal.</td>

            <td>Arduino</td>

            our project, this is a must learn.</td>
