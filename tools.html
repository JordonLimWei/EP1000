        At the beginning of this module, we were tasked to research and select
        software tools that we would like to use for digital fabrication and
        other applications. Below is a table to tools that I personally chosen
        with the corresponding reasons as to why I chose them.

              <tr>
                <td>Text Editor</td>
            <td>Atom</td>
            <td>As introduce by my lecturer, it is said that atom is similar to
            SublimeText3 which is his editor of choice. Selecting Atom will be
            easier to refer to.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Graphics Editor</td>
            <td>GIMP</td>
            <td>GIMP is a graphics editor rivalling Photoshop. Since Photoshop is
            a paid software, the free alterative would be GIMP.</td>

            PicPick is available for Windows operating computers which I am
            using.</td>
