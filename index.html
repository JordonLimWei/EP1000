        Hello there! Welcome to my website where I document all
        the things I learnt and worked on during my time in this
        Digital Fabrication and Prototyping Fundamentals Module(EP1000).
        You can make use of the navigation bar above to navigate around

        <h2>What is EP1000</h2>
      </div>
      <div id="box">
        EP1000 is a module that aims to teach students on how to use Digital
        Fabrication techniques starting from the design concept to the realisation
        of the product, all with the aid of computers and softwares. Designs can
        be created with the use of Computer Aided Design(CAD)
        softwares, 2D and 3D modeling, and product realisation can be fabricated
        with the use of additive and subtractive manufacturing machines, like 3D
        printers, laser cutters and milling machines, with time spent reduced to
        a minimum. All these techniques will come into use on a prototyped
        project students are required to accomplish by the end of the module.
        Web development and version control is an essential part in
        documentation, which will come into play to record down the whole digital
        and fabrication processes of the project.
