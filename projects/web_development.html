        <h2>Purpose of making a website</h2>
      </div>
      <div id="box">
        The purpose of creating a website is to allow us to have a place to
        document any type of information, be it a posting letter, receipt for
        a item paid or a project you are working on.<br>
        In this module, the main objective is to fabricate a physical object and
        a way to document the process is through making a website.<br>
        Advantages:
        <ul>
          <li>Easy to learn and use</li>
          <li>Easy accessible and updatable</li>
          <li>Able to store text, images, video and audio</li>

        <h2>What is HTML</h2>
      </div>
      <div id="box">
        HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard
        language for creating Web pages. It describes the structure of
        the Web page and also has elements that instructs the browser on
        how to display the content.<br>
        The structure is contained in a ".html" file in text form while the
        content is made up of two main parts, the head and the body. The head
        is the title at which the page is defined and the body is where
        the main content lies such as headings and paragraphs of text. Both the
        head and body are tags and are defined in start and end tags. There are
        more tags to allow you to structure your Web page in anyway that you
        like which are included in the next section of learning HTML.

      <div id="box">
        While learning about HTML previously, we know that they are used for
        structuring the contents of a Web page. However, if we would like to
        control the layout while not cluttering the HTML file, we can make use
        of Cascading Style Sheets(CSS).

        <h2>Worked Tutorial by Jake Wright</h2>
      </div>
      <div id="box">
        After learning the properties in the previous part, we were tasked to
        watch a video made by Jake Wright to learn how to create a website with
        layout by using CSS. For this tutorial, I made use of my HTML index file
        to implement the stylesheet.
      </div>
      <div id="box">
        The end result looks something like this:<br>
        <table id="imgTable">
          <tr>
            <td>
              <img src="../images/css/jwCSS_main.jpg">
            </td>
            <td>
              <img src="../images/css/jwCSS_about.jpg">
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>This is the about page</td>
            <td>This is the main page</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </div>
      <div id="box">
        After following along with Jack Wright to create a stylesheet for my
        website, I found some feature and layouts of my website I would like to
        change such as changing the navigation bar to be horizontal and at the
        top of the page such that the container can have more space to display
        the content without obstruction, also, changing the container width to
        be set in percentage which will be more versatile to varying sizes of
        browser resolution.
