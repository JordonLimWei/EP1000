        The purpose of creating a website is to allow us to have a place to

        In this module, the main objective is to fabricate a physical object and

        HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard
        language for creating Web pages. It describes the structure of
        the Web page and also has elements that instructs the browser on
        how to display the content.<br>
        The structure is contained in a ".html" file in text form while the
        content is made up of two main parts, the head and the body. The head
        is the title at which the page is defined and the body is where
        the main content lies such as headings and paragraphs of text. Both the
        head and body are tags and are defined in start and end tags. There are
        more tags to allow you to structure your Web page in anyway that you
        like which are included in the next section of learning HTML.

        of Cascading Style Sheets(CSS).

        After following along with Jack Wright to create a stylesheet for my
        website, I found some feature and layouts of my website I would like to
        change such as changing the navigation bar to be horizontal and at the
        top of the page such that the container can have more space to display
        the content without obstruction, also, changing the container width to
        be set in percentage which will be more versatile to varying sizes of
        browser resolution. Lastly, I would also like to add a dropdown menu for
        the projects icon to display additional sections without having to make
        the horizontal navigation bar to be too long.

        Version control is an essential part to documentation as it is a great
        way to track and manage changes done to your document. And a software
        that I will be using to do so is by Git.

        <h2 id="What is Git">What is Git</h2>
      </div>
      <div id="box">
        Git is a open-source software that tracks changes made to any files and
        consists of two segments, GitHub and GitHub Pages. GitHub makes use of
        Git and is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and
        version control. GitHub Pages builds a website hosted from your
        repository from GitHub where any edits and changes can be easily done
        and reverted if necessary.

      <div>
        <h2 id="How to use GitHub and GitHub Pages">How to use GitHub and GitHub Pages</h2>
      </div>
      <div id="box">
        Firstly, I created an account for GitHub on <a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</a>.<br>
        Next, I set up my repository, <a href="https://github.com/JordonLimWei/EP1000" target="_blank">https://github.com/JordonLimWei/EP1000</a>,
        which is public, with a README file added and MIT License selected. And
        after uploading my website files to the repository, it looks something
        like this:<br>
        <img id="horiImg" src="../images/github/github_repo.jpg">
      </div>
      <div id="box">
        The final setups done to finally get my website hosted on the internet
        is to change some settings in the GitHub Pages. I selected branch as Main,
        and noted that my website is published at <a href="https://jordonlimwei.github.io/EP1000/" target="_blank">https://jordonlimwei.github.io/EP1000/</a>,
        but if you are reading this, you would have already gotten this link.
        The GitHub Pages section should look something like this:<br>

      <div>
        <h2 id="Use of GitHub Desktop for version control">Use of GitHub Desktop for version control</h2>
      </div>
      <div id="box">
        After downloading GitHub Desktop and signed in with my GitHub
        account, I created a repository locally such that the files changed in
        my system will be connected to the repository on GitHub and automatically
        make the changes onto the hosted website.<br>
        While documenting about this, I would need to commit the changes made to
        this html file, which I will be using as a demonstration of how to git
        commit and git push.<br>
      </div>
      <div id="box">
        With reference to the image below, you would be able to see the changes
        made on the left-hand side of the screen.<br>
        <img id="horiImg" src="../images/github/github_desktop_changes.jpg">
      </div>
      <div id="box">
        Add a title to the changes made, in this case, documenting version control,
        press commit to main to git commit. The changes made will be held in
        the local repository.<br>
        <img id="horiImg" src="../images/github/github_desktop_commit.jpg">
      </div>
      <div id="box">
        Finally, if that is all of the changes you would like to make and want
        to host on the website, press push origin to git push.<br>
        <img id="horiImg" src="../images/github/github_desktop_push.jpg">
      </div>
      <div id="box">
        And there you have it, you have learnt how to do git commit and git push
        and the changes has been made to your hosted website!<br>
      </div>
      <div id="box">
        In addition, if you would like to recover or undo changes made, you can
        go to your history and recover older files which will restore your files
        to that version.<br>

      <div id="box">
        For the finalisation of which text editing method I would like to select
        to further the development of this documentation website, I have chosen
        to go with HTML, but this is not to say that Markdown is a bad method
        to documentation as admittedly it is the more efficient and easy to use
        method out of the two. However, with the requirements I need, HTML just
        have an edge on Markdown.<br><br>
        Firstly, HTML gives me full control over everything, down to the finest
        detail. As I am required to include numerous images and information to
        be displayed, Markdown is not able to achieve it in my opinion.<br><br>
        Secondly, with the integration of CSS, my site will look more presentable
        and professional which as compared to Markdown, it is leaps and bounds
        better.<br><br>
        Finally, HTML provides more interactivity to my website with features
        such as, drop-down menu and back-to-top button, which makes my website
        much easier to navigate. Therefore, I decide to use HTML over Markdown.
