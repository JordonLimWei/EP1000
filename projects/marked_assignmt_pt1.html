        <h2>Purpose of making a website</h2>
      </div>
      <div id="box">
        The purpose of creating a website is to allow us to have a place to
        document any type of information, be it a posting letter, receipt for
        a item paid or a project you are working on.<br>
        In this module, the main objective is to fabricate a physical object and
        a way to document the process is through making a website.<br>
        Advantages:
        <ul>
          <li>Easy to learn and use</li>
          <li>Easy accessible and updatable</li>
          <li>Able to store text, images, video and audio</li>

        <h2>What is HTML</h2>
      </div>
      <div id="box">
        HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard
        language for creating Web pages. It describes the structure of
        the Web page and also has elements that instructs the browser on
        how to display the content.<br>
        The structure is contained in a ".html" file in text form while the
        content is made up of two main parts, the head and the body. The head
        is the title at which the page is defined and the body is where
        the main content lies such as headings and paragraphs of text. Both the
        head and body are tags and are defined in start and end tags. There are
        more tags to allow you to structure your Web page in anyway that you
        like which are included in the next section of learning HTML.
