        <h2>Knight Chess Piece</h2>
      </div>
      <div id="box">
        Before looking at how I 3D printed this knight chess piece, have a look
        at how I made the 3D model in Fusion 360
        <a href="3D_modeling.html#Exercise 3: Chess piece - knight">[here]</a>.
        The 3D model in Fusion 360 is first exported into an stereolithography(STL)
        file, then I imported it into CURA which is the software I use to slice
        the STL file into a gcode file to be saved into a SD card to be read and
        printed by the 3D printer.
      </div>
      <div id="box">
        Import into Cura<br>
        <img id="horiImg" src="../images/3D_printing/import_cura.jpg"><br>
        This is how my knight piece looks when the STL file is imported into
        Cura. This visualizes where this 3D model is positioned when printing and
        it's size in relation to the Ultimaker 2+ print space.
      </div>
      <div id="box">
        Print Settings<br>
        <table id="infoTable">
          <tr>
            <td><img id="vertiImg" src="../images/3D_printing/print_settings1.jpg"></td>
            <td><img id="vertiImg" src="../images/3D_printing/print_settings2.jpg"></td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        Here are the final print settings for printing the knight piece. Do note
        that I went through a few iterations in the settings specifically the
        support settings. I will go through my experiences later in this
        documentation.
      </div>
      <div id="box">
        Slicing
        <img id="horiImg" src="../images/3D_printing/sliced.jpg">
        After pressing the slice button, here you can see the model being
        sliced with every red line representing the individual layer that will be
        printed, while the blue lines represent the brim and supports generated.
        At the bottom right, you can also see the estimated print time that it
        would take to complete this 3D print.
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>What Went Wrong</h2>
      </div>
      <div id="box">
        First Failed Print
        <img id="horiImg" src="../images/3D_printing/failed_print1.jpg">
        Here my print have failed, as you can see, the tree support have fallen
        over and I had to stop the print. What I can understand from this is that
        the tree support is not stable and I need to add a brim to improve it's
        stability. There could be another factor, and that is the machine speed
        is too fast resulting in some vibration causing the support to come loose.
        Therefore, I decided to change the print settings and add a brim to the
        print and change to another machine that is set to a slower speed as to
        my knowledge is that the machine speed setting cannot be changed from the
        print settings in Cura.
      </div>
      <div id="box">
        Second Failed Print
        <img id="horiImg" src="../images/3D_printing/failed_print2.jpg">
        After changing to another 3D printing machine and adding the brim,
        the print turned out better but their is still some visible defects due
        to there still being movement and vibration of the tree support, so I
        decided that for the next print, I will make use of a more stable support
        which is the normal support.
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Successful Print</h2>
      </div>
      <div id="box">
        Before Clean Up
        <img id="horiImg" src="../images/3D_printing/final_b4cleanup.jpg">
        After all the trial and error, here you can see the final successfully
        printed knight chess piece, however, with the use of normal support, the
        clean up process is much harder as the support are harder to remove
        though without this type of support, I do not think that I will be able
        to print it successfully.
      </div>
      <div id="box">
        After Clean Up
        <img id="horiImg" src="../images/3D_printing/final_print.jpg">
        Here you can see the final product after clean up, though it is not
        perfect with some areas still having supports not removed, however,
        overall I found that the final product turned out not too bad.
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      </div>
      <div id="box">
        After my experience of preparing the file to using the 3D printer, I
        conclude that it can be quite tricky to fine tune the print settings to
        suite your model and to be able to successfully print it out. My key
        takeaway is to bare in mind how the 3D model is design and trying to
        minimize the amount of overhangs and reduce the reliance of supports,
        however, if the design comes to require overhangs, then the adjustment
        of print settings have to be taken into serious consideration.
